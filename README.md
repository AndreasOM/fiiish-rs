# fiiish-rs

[Fiiish!](http://fiiish.omnimad.net/) is a little game I have been working on,
and using as a testbed for various ideas for a while now.

[This](https://github.com/andreasom/fiiish-rs) is a recreation/remakae from scratch in rust (#rustlang).
All code (inside fiiish-rs folder) is free to use.
I do not own exclusive rights, or reuse rights to the assets, so the original assets (inside fiiish-content, and fiiish-data) are only here for reference,
and may *not* be used, or reused in any way.
I tried to provid dummy data for testing (inside dummy-content, and dummy-data)
which should be (will be) sufficient to run, and test the game.

All of the development is done live on Twitch.
